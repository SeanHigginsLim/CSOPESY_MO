## Project Overview

This is a command-line OS emulator that supports **multitasking, virtual memory, and demand paging**.  
It simulates memory management through paging, process scheduling, and memory visualization, similar to real-world OS tools like `nvidia-smi`, `vmstat`, and Linux `screen`.

---

## Features
* Command-line shell with Linux-style commands
* Demand paging memory allocator
* Backing store for swapped pages (`csopesy-backing-store.txt`)  
* Symbol table for process variables
* `screen -c` with user-defined instructions
* `process-smi` and `vmstat` memory visualizers
* Memory access violation handling
