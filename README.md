## Project Overview

This is a command-line OS emulator that supports **multitasking, virtual memory, and demand paging**.  
It simulates memory management through paging, process scheduling, and memory visualization, similar to real-world OS tools like `nvidia-smi`, `vmstat`, and Linux `screen`.

---

## Features
* Command-line shell with Linux-style commands
* Demand paging memory allocator
* Backing store for swapped pages (`csopesy-backing-store.txt`)  
* Symbol table for process variables
* `screen -c` with user-defined instructions
* `process-smi` and `vmstat` memory visualizers
* Memory access violation handling

## Build Instructions
### Requirements
- C++11 or higher
- g++ / clang++ or Visual Studio

### Compile with g++ (Linux/macOS/WSL)
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -o os_emulator main.cpp console.cpp [add...]

## Compilation

Use the following command to compile the program:

```
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp console.cpp scheduler.cpp process.cpp variable_manager.cpp config.cpp -o main.exe -pthread
```

## Running the Program

```
./main.exe   # On Linux/macOS
main.exe     # On Windows
```

## Entry Point

The program starts execution in the `CSOPESY_MO` class, located in `main.cpp`.
